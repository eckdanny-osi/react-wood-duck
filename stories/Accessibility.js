                issues affecting their websites or applications. It&#39;s broken
                down into three sections of decreasing importance: A, B and C.

                compliant. This checklist should be used as a reference for
                development and is not a substitute for compliance checks by a

            <h2>Form Accessibility</h2>
            <ul className="styleguide">
              <li>
                Display form controls in the same order in HTML as they appear
                on screen. Do not use CSS to rearrange the form controls. Screen
                readers narrate forms in the order they appear in the HTML.
              </li>
              <li>
                Visually align validation messages with the input fields, so
                people using screen magnifiers can read them quickly.
              </li>
              <li>
                Group each set of thematically related controls in a fieldset
                element. Use the legend element to offer a label within each
                one. The fieldset and legend elements make it easier for screen
                reader users to navigate the form.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use a single legend for fieldset (this is required). One example
                of a common use of fieldset and legend is a question with radio
                button options for answers. The question text and radio buttons
                are wrapped in a fieldset, with the question itself being inside
                the legend tag.
              </li>
              <li>
                Embed multiple fieldsets and legends for more complex forms.
              </li>
              <li>
                Keep your form blocks in a vertical pattern. This approach is
                ideal, from an accessibility standpoint, because of limited
                vision that makes it hard to scan from right to left.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Supporting screen readers</h2>
            <p className="styleguide">
              Note: These code examples have been designed to support a range of
              screen readers. That said, they may not work with all versions.

            <ul className="styleguide">
              <li>
                VoiceOver on iOS currently does not support fieldset and legend
                for forms. You can address this by using
                aria-labeledby=&#39;for-attribute-of-label id-of-legend
                id-of-additional-info&#39; on each input in the fieldset. Using
                aria-labeledby will overwrite the default text read by the
                screen reader, so it is important to include all relevant
                information.
              </li>
              <li>
                VoiceOver on OS X currently does not support. aria-describedby
                Use aria-labeledby instead, and include all related fields,
                including, labels, legend, and hint text
